  I have heard from a few people interested in giving donations via paypal.  I don't use paypal because I don't like
the way it is setup and run, but I do use bitcoin.  Please foward any donations to the following bitcoin address.

Note: feature requests that are accompanied by donations are much more likely to be implemented :-).
